# README

KorokDB is a database of Nintendo Switch catridges. The goal of this project is to:

 - Note what game version a cartridge revision maps to. 
 - Note if a specific cartridge revision is unplayable without patching.
 - Be completely user-submitted.
 - Open source the data so that if one day KorokDB ceases to exist, the data is still available.
